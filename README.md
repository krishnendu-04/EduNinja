### Project Description🗣️
The AI-Powered Course Finder Web App is a smart platform that provides users with a way to find the best suitable online courses based on their preferences. The app pulls real-time course data from popular e-learning servers, including Coursera, Udemy, and youtube, using web scraping and APIs, arranges the data into structured databases, and presents personalized course recommendations via an intuitive web interface. 

### The Problem statement📜

With the inexorable rise of online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, youtube students and professionals alike have found it increasingly impossible to easily find the right course for themselves, based on things such as their own interest, budget, and competence level. Existing platforms do not offer a centralized AI-enabled solution that can help compare courses from multiple providers.

EduNinja, our solution, aims to eradicate this problem by putting users able to search, filter, and receive personalized recommendations with course data aggregated from various e-learning platforms, in one place. With the help of web scraping, APIs, and suggestions based on AI, we have set out to ease the process of course selection and enhance the learning experience for users.
